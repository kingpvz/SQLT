# SQLT
SimpleQueryList (SQLT) is an Array Management Language made by me in Python.

SQLT only works for Python 3.10 and later. If you want to use it with an older version, download `SimpleQueryList.py` from the `Pre 3.10` folder. Keep in mind however, this is an old version with very limited functionality. Last updated in November 2023.

Download `SimpleQueryList.py` and run it in order to work with it. Yep, it's that simple!<br>
Write command `help tutorial` for a simple tutorial to get you started. It will teach you the basic commands in SQLT.
